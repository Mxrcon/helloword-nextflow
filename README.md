# helloword-nextflow
a simple project trying to run all Hello words from different languages using nextflow

my Name is Davi and i'm an enthusiast of doing easy things but in a hard way, and this is my simple project to show how nextflow can be used to manage scripts on different languages.

## Next steps:
* add new langugages
* add a docker container with all compilers


## Instructions

1. Install nextflow following the tutorial on [nextflow website](nextflow.io)
2. Run it : 

```
nextflow run https://github.com/Mxrcon/helloword-nextflow 

```
## Requirements:

while i don't have time to deploy a docker container with the compilers, you'll have to manually install the compilers to all languages featured in this script


## Languages featured:

* Nextflow
* Python 3
* Ruby
